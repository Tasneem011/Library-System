Project Title
Library Management System API

Project Description
A Library Management System API built using Spring Boot that allows librarians to manage books, patrons, and borrowing records. The system supports CRUD operations for books and patrons, manages borrowing records, and includes features for validation, error handling, optional security, caching, transaction management, and testing.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For creating the RESTful API and managing the applicationâ€™s configuration and services.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
Spring Security (Optional): For implementing basic authentication or JWT-based authorization.
Spring Caching (Optional): For improving performance through caching.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) (Optional): For logging and performance monitoring.
JUnit & Mockito: For unit and integration testing of services, controllers, and repositories.
H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL: For data storage, with H2 for in-memory testing and MySQL or PostgreSQL for production.
ModelMapper: For mapping between DTOs and entities.
Lombok: For reducing boilerplate code with annotations like @RequiredArgsConstructor and @Slf4j.
Docker (Optional): For containerizing the application (if used).
